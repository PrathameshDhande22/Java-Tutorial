### What is Design Pattern ?

**Design patterns** are typical solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design. They are like pre-made blueprints that you can customize to solve a recurring design problem in your code.

## Three Main Patterns

- **Creational patterns** provide object creation mechanisms that increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.
- **Structural patterns** explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.
- **Behavioral patterns** take care of effective communication and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.
