### 1. Strategy Pattern:
The **Strategy Pattern** is a behavioral design pattern that defines a family of algorithms or behaviors, encapsulates each one as a separate class, and makes them interchangeable. It allows an object to change its behavior at runtime by switching between different strategies, without modifying the code that uses them.
### 2. Observer Pattern:
The **Observer Pattern** is a behavioral design pattern that establishes a one-to-many relationship between objects. When the state of one object (called the **subject**) changes, all its dependent objects (called **observers**) are automatically notified and updated. This helps keep data consistent across different parts of an application without tightly coupling the components.
### 3. Decorator Pattern:
The **Decorator Pattern** is a structural design pattern that allows you to add new functionalities or responsibilities to an object dynamically without altering its existing structure or code. It wraps the original object with additional behavior, providing a flexible alternative to subclassing.
### 4. Factory Method Pattern
The **Factory Method Pattern** is a creational design pattern that defines an interface for creating objects but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate. It allows a class to defer instantiation to its subclasses, promoting flexibility and loose coupling.
### 5. Abstract Factory Pattern
The **Abstract Factory Pattern** is a creational design pattern that provides an interface to create families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. It helps ensure that products created together are compatible and promotes consistency across different object families.
### 6. Singleton Pattern
The **Singleton Pattern** is a creational design pattern that ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. Itâ€™s useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across a system.
### 7. Command Pattern
The **Command Pattern** is a behavioral design pattern that encapsulates a request or action as an object, allowing you to parameterize, queue, or log requests, and support undoable operations. It decouples the object that invokes the action from the object that performs it.
### 8. Adapter Pattern
The **Adapter Pattern** is a structural design pattern that allows incompatible interfaces to work together by converting one interface into another that the client expects. It acts as a bridge between two incompatible classes.
### 9. Facade Pattern
The **Facade Pattern** is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified, unified interface to a complex subsystem, making it easier for clients to interact with the system without dealing with its internal complexity.
### 10. Iterator Pattern
The **Iterator Pattern** is a behavioral design pattern that provides a way to access elements of a collection sequentially without exposing its underlying representation, allowing uniform traversal of different collection types.
### 11. Composite Pattern
The **Composite Pattern** is a structural design pattern that lets you compose objects into tree-like structures to represent part-whole hierarchies, allowing clients to treat individual objects and groups of objects uniformly.
